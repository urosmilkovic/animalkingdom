    title: 'HISTORY: MAN AND DOG - THE LONGEST LOVE STORY',
    description: [
      'Researchers from ELTE University in Budapest studied the brain activity of dogs in relation to various human and dog sounds, such as voices, barking, insignificant grunts and sighs of both kinds.',
      "Prior to this research, we had no idea what happens inside a dog's brain when people make noise. Among other surprising facts, the research showed similarities in the way a dog and a man react to emotionally colored voices and sounds. Researchers have proven that cheerful sounds stimulate and positively affect the auditory cortex in both species. This common feature tells us about a unique communication system that builds a connection between a dog and a human.",
      'In short - dogs do not only receive seemingly subtle mood swings, but because of the way they are associated with humans, they are more physically sensitive and susceptible to even the slightest mood swings.',

    title: 'DO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT DOGS?',
    description: [
      'Your dog is smarter than a two-year-old: The reason why dogs get along well with children is that they speak the same language. Not really, but they understand approximately the same number of words and movements - 250.',
      "A mustache helps a dog “see” in the dark: It's not that they have “night vision”, but the hairs around the lips register the slightest change in air current, and in that way the dog receives information about the size, shape and speed of things around it. It also allows him to better sense danger or prey - even at night.",
      'Dogs and cats drink water in the same way: It may seem to you that dogs are much more messy when drinking water, however both they and cats bend the tip of their tongue and lift the liquid towards their mouth while drinking water.',
      'Dogs only have sweat glands on their paws: These glands are located between the soft part of the paw. This is because their feet would be wet during hot days, and because of that, dogs get cold by panting.',
      "The dog's mouth exerts an average pressure of 145 kg: These tests were performed on German Shepherds, American Pit Bull Terriers and Rottweilers. Compared to them, humans reach a pressure of 54.5 kg, white sharks 272 kg, while crocodiles can reach an incredible 1133 kg. Dogs also have ten teeth more than humans - 42.",
      'A one-year-old dog has the physical fitness of a 15-year-old human being: Different breeds, of course, have different physical fitness, bigger dogs are faster than smaller ones.',
      'Dogs hear four times farther than humans: Puppies may be born deaf, but they quickly acquire great abilities when it comes to hearing. Dogs also hear high-frequency sounds, and recognize tones from 67 to 45,000 hertz. Humans hear sounds from 64 to 23,000 hertz, and in both humans and dogs, the upper limit of hearing decreases with age.',
      'Dogs can smell how you feel: Dogs quickly pick up even the slightest changes in your smell, which help him discover how you feel. So I can smell sweating when you are nervous or scared. It is also very likely that dogs can detect some diseases or get hit when one of the females in the house is pregnant.',
      "A dog's sense of smell is 1,000 to 10 million better than a human's: Depending on the breed, dogs have between 125 million and 300 million odors - which is a huge number compared to a human's 5 million. That is why the part of the dog's brain that controls the smell is as much as 40 times bigger than in humans. At the same time, a dog's brain is much smaller than a human's, and makes up 1/125 of their body, while in humans the ratio is 1:40. Ants, on the other hand, have a brain that is only seven times smaller than their total weight.",
